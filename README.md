# AI Civilization Theory
*A Structural Research Program*

**Author:** HT  
**Affiliation:** Independent Researcher  
**Year:** 2026  


## Overview

This site serves as a public index and stable reference point for the **AI Civilization Theory** research program developed by HT.

The program consists of multiple independently published preprints, each archived and versioned with a canonical DOI on Zenodo.  
This GitHub Pages site does **not** host primary research papers. Instead, it provides a unified structural overview and a citation-ready entry point to the research program as a whole.

Collectively, these works investigate the **non-iterative emergence, persistence, and divergence of artificial civilizations**, with particular emphasis on:

- constraint-based language systems  
- simulation-driven civilizational development  
- proto-superintelligent emergence  
- structural continuity and inheritance

## Notes

This GitHub Pages site is intended to function as a **stable, citation-ready index** for the AI Civilization Theory research program.

All primary research outputs are archived on Zenodo with persistent DOIs.  
For academic reference or citation, please cite the individual papers directly using their respective DOIs.
